# About Me

👋 Hi! Welcome to my GitHub.

🦀 I work as a senior fullstack developer, doing mostly TypeScript, JavaScript, React, Next, etc. I've also increasingly started to use Rust for a lot of my own personal software development: not because it's the easiest language to learn (or write), but because it has empowered me to create things I never would have dreamed of working on when I previously only worked with JavaScript (see live web demos pinned below).

🎵 I used to be a classical composer by trade. I was getting my Masters degree in Music Composition at the University of Texas when I stumbled upon programming and fell in love with it. I became so obsessed with programming that I spent the last few months of my final semester avoiding my music studies to spend every possible minute coding. This is ultimately what convinced me to leave my masters degree and become a programmer. I am still a classical composer--I occasionally write pieces that are published--but it is no longer my profession. I do, however, think that that same drive for creativity and technical excellence has informed what I love most in software engineering.

💻 I like to dive deep into various computer science fields when time permits. Some of the topics that interest me the most are: graphics programming (ray tracers, custom shaders, WebGL, WebGPU, etc.), digital signal processing (Granular Synthesizers, Max MSP, etc.), programming language research (creating my own programming languages), creative coding, type theory, and small-scale projects which are technically constrained and serve no utility: such as implementing assembly interpreters in the TypeScript type system or writing WebAssembly code by hand.

👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 Finally, I'm a husband and a father--undoubtedly the two most important jobs I will ever have. These types of things are not typically what people come to a GitHub readme to read about, though, so thanks for sticking with it this far.

💬 I always love to connect with other developers and people who share the same interests as me, so feel free to reach out.
