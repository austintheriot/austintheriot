Hi! Welcome to my GitHub. 

I'm a frontend developer by day, working mostly with TypeScript, JavaScript, React, Next, Node, etc.

I also enjoy working on side projects outside of work, especially projects that involve creative coding in some way. For those projects, I've increasingly started to rely on Rust--specifically Rust compiled to WebAssembly. I now use Rust for pretty much all of my own personal software development: not because it's an easy language to learn (or write), but because it has empowered me to create things I never would have dreamed of working on when I previously only worked with JavaScript.

I used to be a classical composer. I was getting my Masters degree in Music Composition at the University of Tecas when I stumbled on programming and fell in love with it. I loved it so much, in fact, that I spent the last few months of my final semester trying to code every waking moment, which is ultimately what convinced me to drop out of my masters degree and become a programmer. I am still a classical composer--I ocassionally write published pieces for money--but it is not my profession. I do think that that same drive for creativity and technical excellence, however, has informed what I love most in software engineering. 

I like to dabble in various computer science fields when time permits. Some of the things that interest me the most are: graphics programming (ray tracers, custom shaders, WebGL, etc.), digitial signal processing (coding Granular Synthesizers, etc.), programming language research (building my own languages), type theory (though I know very little about it), and small-scale projects which are technically constrained and serve no utility: such as implementing assembly interpreters in the TypeScript type system.

Finally, I'm a husband and a father--undoubtdely the two most important and meaningul jobs I'll ever have. Those things are not typically what people come to a GitHub readme to read about, though, so thanks sticking with it this far. 

I always love to connect with other developers and people who share the same interests as me, so feel free to reach out.
